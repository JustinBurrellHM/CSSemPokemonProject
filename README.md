There are 18 types in Pokémon: bug, dark, dragon, electric, fairy, fighting, fire, flying, ghost, grass, ground, ice, normal, poison, psychic, rock, steel, and water, and each type has strengths and weaknesses aganist other types. For example, water is stronger aganist fire, but weaker aganist grass.
